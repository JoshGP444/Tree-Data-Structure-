The To-Do List Application is a simple Java program that helps users manage tasks. It uses a heap-based priority queue to ensure tasks with higher priority are addressed first.
1. Add Task: Add a task with a description and priority (1 - Lowest, 10 - Highest).
2. View All Tasks: View all tasks in the queue in priority order.
3. Mark Task as Done: Remove and mark the highest-priority task as completed.
4. Exit: Exit the application
